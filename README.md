# Hey! I'm Waddlin' Here!

Your everyday average penguin is just trying to waddle across the street in The
Big Apple. Wait... how wide is this road?

Use your mouse to choose your upgrades, and use the left and right arrow keys
move once you start waddling.

Use spacebar to roll (it's like Dark Souls!) and "x" to use the Thor Zone (once
you've unlocked it, it's the thunderbolts). The Thor Zone stops all cars in the
purple zone, but has a cooldown timer.
